A simple and stylish popup chatbot UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by the OpenRouter AI API.
Easily embeddable on any website!

No server required — it's pure frontend!

⚙️ How It Works
User clicks the 💬 floating button.

A popup chatbot appears.

User types a question → API request is sent to OpenRouter.

AI responds, and the message is rendered in Markdown format.

 Add "Bot is typing..." indicator
